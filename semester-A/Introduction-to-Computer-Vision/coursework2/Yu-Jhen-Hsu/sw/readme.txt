Each sections is divided by %% line

The first section is used to get the dataset.

The following sections are correspond to different question(shown in comment)
The section of different question will prvodie the function being used in this question
followed by the subquestion
ex. Running the 1(a) section to the answer for question 1a
Each section will show figures and the images inside sw folder after executing it.

It should runs in order because the 5c will generate the background image which is used in the 5d question.
