Because the function provided - 'blurry_memory' is interpreted using python 3.6, so you should set the project interpreter as python 3.6 to run the functions.

For question 1, I use two major functions to implement (a) and (d) respectively. Function uniform_cost_search is used to find the path with shortest distance cost, and function ucs_d is used to solve the question (d).

For question 2, in the previous part I find the two passwords for (a). In the last part, I run the code 100 times to find the average number of the reproductions and the variance of the reproduction number.
